# FishGPT Backend
FishGPT is an online chatbot built with ChatGPT that allows a user to simultaneously watch a fish and ask it questions to be answered! It uses computer vision to track the fish location in the tank to select a response and simulate different fish emotions and mood.

To run the server:
